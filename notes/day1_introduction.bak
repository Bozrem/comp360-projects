; Day 1
; Welcome to Racket!

; add x = 3 to the current environment

; adds y = 7 to the current environment

; to evaluate an addition, evaluate the subexpressions and add 

; to evaluate a variable, lookup its value in the environment  

; evaluates (- x y), which results in -4, then
; adds z = -4 to the current environment

; evaluates the whole math expression: q = (x + 2) * (z - 3), 
; which results in -35
; adds q = -35 to the current environment

; let's introduce control flow to compute absolute values

; let's display the results of what we've done

; now let's try to break things a little bit!
